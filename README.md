## What is Tiwizi ?
Tiwizi is a traditional Amazigh principle of collective solidarity and mutual aid. It refers to a form of voluntary cooperation where members of a community work together to help one another, without financial compensation. Tiwizi is based on the idea that community strength comes from cooperation, not individualism.
## How Tiwizi Works
In Amazigh society, when someone needs help, the community comes together:
- Harvesting crops
- Building a house
- Farming and irrigation
- Preparing for weddings or communal events
Each person contributes time, effort, and skills, knowing that when their turn comes, the community will help them in return.
- No money is exchanged.
- The reward is solidarity, dignity, and shared responsibility
## Core Values of Tiwizi
Tiwizi is built on strong human values:
- Solidarity – helping without expecting immediate return
- Equality – everyone contributes according to ability
- Belonging – no one is left behind
- Collective responsibility – success is shared
- Trust and respect
## Tiwizi and Open Source
Tiwizi aligns naturally with Open Source philosophy:
|  Tiwizi | Open Source  |
|---|---|
| Community effort  |  Collaborative development |
| Knowledge sharing | Open code and documentation |
| No financial obligation | Voluntary contribution |
| Collective benefit | Shared innovation |

This makes Tiwizi a perfect cultural foundation for technology communities like Tiwizi Tech Community.
## Modern Meaning of Tiwizi
Today, Tiwizi is not only about physical labor. It has evolved into:
- Knowledge sharing
- Teaching and mentoring
- Digital collaboration
- Open-source software development
- Community-driven innovation
Tiwizi proves that ancient wisdom can guide modern technology.
